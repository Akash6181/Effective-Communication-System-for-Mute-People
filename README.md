# Effective-Communication-System-for-Mute-People

     The mute community around the globe has a hard time communicating with the rest of the 
world's population. This communication gap is there because a dumb person uses sign language 
which is not comprehensible by a normal person. This project mainly focuses on removing the 
barrier of communication between the mute community and the people not familiar with the 
concept of sign language so that the messages that a dumb person is trying to relay is 
understandable to a person with no knowledge of sign language. The design of the device is based 
on embedded systems. Flex sensors and Arduino are the key components.

     The proposed method, the use of hand gesture reading system fitted with gestures and flex 
sensors linked to each finger and Linked as input to the RF Transmitter along with the speaker 
unit. This machine is operated by a battery-powered circuitry. Just run it. Also, this device will 
include various terms and phrases that will help mute people send simple messages. This is the 
Device reads the hand gesture of a stupid person for various differences in the movement of the 
hand. The processor is continuously receiving input Sensor values and then process them, then 
look for a corresponding message for a set of sensor values. Once it has been found in memory, 
an interfaced speaker retrieves the message and speaks it using text for speech processing.

     The main motivation is to design a flexible, compact and cost-effective system based 
on embedded systems. The key factors to consider in the designing are comfort of the user, 
generality, performance, compactness (simplicity) and cost-effectiveness. The principal idea of the 
design is to recognize hand movements and gestures and facilitate a medium of communication to 
the people who cannot communicate by talking. These hand movements should be recognized and 
should be converted into words and provide a natural way of communication just like talking.
According to the world health organization, about 5%, approximately 70 million, of the world's 
population is deaf and mute. Sign language is the way through which they communicate with each 
other. It has been observed that impaired people find it very difficult to interact with society. 
Normal individuals aren't able to understand their sign language. To bridge this gap, this project is 
developed for the physically impaired people and would be beneficial as they can communicate 
with everyone. The system provides communication between dumb and normal people. It is also 
useful for mute people and paralyzed people are those who do not speak properly. This system 
eliminates the barrier in communication between the mute community and the normal people.
 
     A person with speaking disability faces difficulty in communicating with the rest of the 
population. This device is developed to improve the lifestyle of a person who has speaking 
disability. This device converts the gesture to speech i.e., gives voice to a mute person. Speech is 
one of the important factors required for the humans to convey their messages. In this project, Flex 
sensors play the major role. They are stitched to the gloves. The output from the flex sensors is fed 
into the Arduino development board. Arduino converts the analog signal to digital by Using ADC 
pins and then the data is sent to LCD display and gives voice output where the speech output is 
obtained using a speaker.
